    <h1>FxRoad Review - Is FxRoad.com a Scam? ‚ö†Ô∏è</h1>
    <p class="rating">Rating: 1/5 ‚≠ê</p>
    <p><strong>FxRoad.com</strong> is a broker that has raised numerous red flags. Operated by <strong>4Square SY Ltd</strong>, a Seychelles-incorporated company with FSA license number SD052, this broker lacks the regulatory oversight needed to ensure trader safety. In this review, we‚Äôll explore why FxRoad.com is a risky choice for traders and why it deserves a <strong>1-star rating</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Weak Regulatory Oversight</h2>
    <p>FxRoad.com is regulated by the <strong>Seychelles Financial Services Authority (FSA)</strong>, which is known for its relaxed requirements. Unlike top-tier regulators such as the FCA (UK), ASIC (Australia), CySEC (Cyprus), and SEC (USA), the FSA does not enforce strict rules on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Segregation of client funds</li>
        <li>Negative balance protection</li>
        <li>Compensation schemes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In fact, all a broker needs to operate under the FSA is a $50,000 fee and a small office. There are no rigorous checks to ensure the safety of consumer funds.</p>

    <h2>High Spreads and Hidden Costs</h2>
    <p>FxRoad charges high spreads, with their Silver and Gold account types starting from <strong>2.0 pips to 2.6 pips</strong>. This is significantly above the market average, making it expensive for traders to execute trades.</p>

    <h2>No Demo Account</h2>
    <p>FxRoad does not offer a demo account, which is a major red flag. A demo account is essential for traders to practice and test the platform before committing real money. The absence of a demo account suggests that FxRoad may not be transparent about its trading conditions.</p>

    <h2>Fake Reviews and Lack of Trust</h2>
    <p>FxRoad has sponsored numerous reviews, and their Trustpilot profile is filled with fake reviews. Many of these reviews appear to be generated by paid individuals or employees of FxRoad. This lack of authenticity further undermines the credibility of the broker.</p>

    <h2>Key Facts About FxRoad</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Details</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Regulator</td>
            <td>Seychelles FSA (Weak Oversight)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Spreads</td>
            <td>2.0 - 2.6 pips (Above Market Rate)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Demo Account</td>
            <td>‚ùå Not Available</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Trustpilot Reviews</td>
            <td>üö© Fake and Sponsored</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Conclusion: Avoid FxRoad.com</h2>
    <p>FxRoad.com is a broker with weak regulation, high spreads, and a lack of transparency. The absence of a demo account and the presence of fake reviews make it a risky choice for traders. We strongly advise avoiding this broker and choosing a more reputable alternative.</p>
